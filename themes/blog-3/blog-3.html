				The First Button is a computer program which is written in the most magnificient language crafted by <code><strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong></code> called "C". Well I know this is 2020 & we have a more better languages than C but the first button for your programming career OR a newbie to computers you always start your days with "C". If you want to learn any language the first progarm you will scribble will be printing out "Hello, World!" on your Terminal.<br>
		&nbsp; A Computer is a machine which perform calculation by fraction of second. Calculation in the sense, it palys with 0's & 1's i.e it understands only language of 0's & 1's . This language of 0's and 1's is called Binary Language.<br>
		<code>PROCESSOR!</code> <br>
		There is a Processor in your machine which performs this magic in fractions. A Processor has small Transistors in it which switches <code>ON(1's)</code> or OFF(0's) as the signals are sent.
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8">Zoom Into Microchip</a> will give you an idea.<br>
		We'll move on further for writing the code in "C".
		Open a code editor on your machine such as Sublime and follow the following.
		<img class="gif" src="./2.gif">
		<pre><code>
CODE<br>
	/*Commenting in C*/	
	#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

	int main(void)
	{
		printf("Hello, World!\n");
	}	
</code></pre>
			<li>
				The first line of code defines COMMENTING. This line is not processed and is used as normal language for understandin 
			</li>
			<li>
				2<sup>nd</sup> line defined the standard input/output library. It is used to call a funtion printf from "C" library.
			</li>
			<li>
				3<sup>rd</sup> line is a main function and all other code will go in between curly braces <code>{...}</code> here which will print whatever is typed in between <code>printf("...")</code> 
			</li>
			<li>
				Next line contains the function imported by <code>stdio.h</code> library used for printing the output.
			</li>
			<li>
			After compiling the code a file named <code>a.out</code> will be generated. This file contains the binary form of the program.
			</li>
			<li>
				To execute this binary form you need to run the file using<br><code>./a.out</code> this will print out the output to your terminal.
			</li><br>
			<p style="text-align: center;">Hence this was just an overview how the program works in a computer. I hope you enjoy your programming.
