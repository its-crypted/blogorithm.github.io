  <h2> What is OPEN SOURCE?</h2><br>
  Welcome to the World of OPEN SOURCE<br>
  It's simple as that, the name itself describes the meaning- Open means open for anyone, anywhere and containig freedom.<b> Source</b> defining the Source code. Both combined together gives the Open Source. Now these permission are enforced through an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">Open Source Licenses</a>
  Well if you use LAPTOP or PC then you must be using a Windows 10 as an Operating System(OS). The same way there is OS for MAC users known as MAC OS. Now There is one more OS which is known to be as <strong><b>LINUX</b></strong>, available for free and is not known for most of the people OR are not familiar with it.
  <p class="clear"><br /></p>
  Now Windows and MAC OS  are popular because they come preinstalled when you buy a "LAPTOP" or "PC" and are also know as proprietary(paid version) OS. But Linux is never preinstalled in machine because it's free and a company cannot make business form it, where on the other hand while buying a Machine you pay for the proprietary OS so that it can work on your machine. Windows and MAC OS have their source code close and people cannot see how these OS works i.e you cannot unfold that how the software was designed, in which programming language it was written, what algorithms are used,etc you can just use the software without questioning about the built.<br>
  Talking about LINUX as I already said it's free and is distributed under GNU General Public License(GNU GPL) i.e you can check the entire code for this Operating System. You can modify it, change it as you want, which is the best part of linux. You can even create yourself an OS by using other's source code and can delete things which you don't really want in your OS. Proprietary systems don't provide this flexibility you have to live with what you have given, for e.g- In windows the update for the softwares is concluded automatically i.e WINDOWS OS check for update and directly starts updating without asking your preference that I want to update these software or not, and you don't have a choice.<br> 
  In LINUX first of all it gives you a preference of selectivity to choose what software you want to update and which you don't. Here you get a choice of your own.
  <p class="clear"><br /></p>

  Now to understand <b>LINUX</b> we must understand,<strong><b>What is Operating Sytem?</b></strong><br /> 
  An Operating System cannot be seen on your computer while you work. Basically you never use an OS... you use programs or software(e.g Notepad, powerpoint-for presentation, Games, browsers, etc) which fulfill your needs. And to run these programs you need an OS which interact with the hardware which you consider as your necessisity while buying a machine(Lappy or PC) like - 1tb Hard disk, 4GB graphics card, 8GB RAM, core i7-9<sup>th</sup> Gen processor and many more aspects. To run your programs on a computer screen you need to have an OS which will take the input form software which you are running and give it to a processor for producing an output & display it onto your screen as desired. 
  <br>
  There are many types of LINUX distributions released, but most popular ones are Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, RedHat, OpenSUSE,etc and list goes on...<br>
